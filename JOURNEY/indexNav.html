 <p id="book introduction">
    <p class="summary" >Almost all South Africans profess some religious affiliation .Christianity among other religions was brought by Europeans and other settlers. Religion was expected to unite them but that was not the case. In fact it has separated them more than ever. According to this book, religion has made them relate all the problems we have with someone that’s “<strong>the devil</strong>”. The author’s mother is too religious in this context that she relates everything with religion.In one of the book’s most hilarious passages, Noah recounts a theological debate with his mother on one Sunday morning when her second-hand car wouldn’t start . The author’s mother directly relates the breaking down of the car on a Sunday morning as the work of the devil in trying to stop them from going to church. She further goes ahead and compliments that everything she has is because of attending church.</p>
                 <h2 class="topic">Division</h2>
                
    <p class="summary" >The point of choosing different churches at different times is openly showing us how what seems to be a unifying factor has turned out to be the reason we are not together. If we really trusted in one God, one heaven, one hell and one savior who will come for us then we shouldn’t be where we are today. It has made the society in this book dedicate almost the whole week in worship. Being in the same religion hasn’t helped us because we still view things and do things differently in that religion including  our songs, analysis of the scriptures, passion and catharsis.</p>

    <p class="summary">Religion has also separated them into social classes i.e. the state of the churches is not the same. Time spent in the religion is not the same too. Same religion have different churches and have different programs. In this context, the white church is located in the suburb and was big enough to have different sections. They even had reading materials for the children and the youth, something that could’t be found in the African churches. The mixed church again embraces its own distinct racial makeup. It’s kind of music and arrangement makes the author feel at ease compared to the others.</p>

                 <h3 class="topic" >Satisfaction</h3>
    <p  class="summary">The author openly points out that “<strong>black people needs more time with just Jesus because they suffer more</strong> ".This relates to “<strong>the reason they stay in church for long hours seeking the solution to their problems</strong>”. Also being in the same religion doesn’t make us the same. An example of this is where the authors mother is too religious while the grandmother mixes Jesus with the traditional beliefs of communicating with the ancestors. Africans abandoning their indigenous religion and embracing Christianity had no positive reason. And the end of the day each of them was viewed different in respect to what they look like in the new religion.</p>

    <p  class="summary">In the book also, I get to learn of how religion can’t be satisfying at times. The author and the mother keep attending almost four services in a day and get home at night in the name of coming from church. That’s like being a slave to religion in some way. The author’s mother tells us somewhere that obstacles are there to test our strength meaning to her all problems she faces are not just human caused.</p>
    <p class="summary" >Noah was raised solely by his mother in a devoutly Christian environment, where he was held up to a strict code of behavior and physically disciplined by her when he stepped out of line. He was the go-to guy at prayer meetings that were often held at his grandparents’ house and attended church weeknights and often multiple times on Sundays.In other ways too, religion was positive since it determined the kind of material the author was subjected to. He says that he listened to songs that kids in his school could not listen too that’s gospel songs. There was no movies. The church helped in his upbringing and provided a good environment .His job was to learn of bible heroes i.e. Samson </p>

                 <h4  class="topic">Comfort</h4>
   <p class="summary"  > To the author and his mother and other people who had gone through colonization, religion is a source of solace and has a lot of meaning. It gives them the hope in the difficult times and makes them follow the colonizers custom. Noah’s mother is a devout Christian who believes more and longer days in church will bring more blessings and her prayers will be answered .Back in the village during the prayer meetings, the extended family values Noah’s participation in prayers circles .The moment he prays in English, they believe that God has heard that prayer and has given it more attention.</p> 
     
     <p  class="summary"  > This shows that the family is optimistic that their advantages in the Christianity brought to them if they emulate the colonizers who brought the form of religion to South Africa</p>
    <p class="summary" > In conclusion, religion has brought both positive and negative to the people in South Africa</p>
